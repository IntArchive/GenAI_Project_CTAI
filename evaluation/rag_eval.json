Check the index status of your page\nIf you're not sure about the index status of a page, you can use [Google's URL Inspection tool] (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) or [the Wix Site Inspection tool] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-site-inspection-an-overview) to check it. These tools can tell you if your page is indexed or if there are any issues that are preventing it from being indexed.\n\n3. Check if your pages has any redirects\nWix's URL Redirect Manager lets you create 301 redirects for pages on your site. 301 redirects tell web browsers that the URL of a page on your site has changed permanently to a new URL. It also tells browsers that visitors who try to access the page's old URL should be sent to the new URL instead.\n\nIf your page has a 301 redirect and the page doesn't appear in search results, try deleting the redirect.\n\n1. [Go to your SEO Dashboard] (https://manage.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO).\n2. Select Go to URL Redirect Manager under Tools and settings.\n3. Hover over the 301 redirect that you want to delete.\n4. Click the Delete icon . \n\n4. Submit Sitemap: Make sure your sitemap is submitted to Google. Wix automatically submits your sitemap, but you can also do it [manually via Google Search Console] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/submitting-your-sitemap-and-urls-directly-to-search-engines).\n\nHowever, search engines cannot guarantee that every page of your site will be indexed. It's important to note that this is perfectly normal in many cases. \n",

If you pay in a supported currency (e.g. EUR, GBP, JPY, USD) the ad credits are in the same currency. For all other currencies, ad credits in your dashboard show as USD.

      "reference_answer": "When you publish your site, most of your pages are available for search engines like Google to crawl and index so that they can appear in search results. It can take some time for your page to appear. \nHowever, search engines cannot guarantee that every page of your site will be indexed. It's important to note that this is perfectly normal in many cases. \n\nTo check if your site was indexed by search engines, search \"site:\" followed by your site's domain with no spaces. For example: site:wix.com\n  If any of your domain's pages are listed in the search results, those pages have been indexed. If there are no results for your domain, your website has not been indexed yet. \n\nCheck that you have allowed search engines to crawl your site.\n\nTo enable search engines to index your site:\n1. [Go to your SEO dashboard.] (https://manage.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO)\n2. Select Go to SEO Settings under Tools and settings.\n3. Selecting SEO Settings in your site's dashboard\n4. Make sure the Let search engines index your site toggle is enabled.\n\nWhen you complete the steps in your Wix SEO Setup Checklist, Wix automatically submits your sitemap index to Google for you. When you make changes to your site, your sitemap will be automatically updated with the changes. There's no need to submit your sitemap to Google again. \nIf you want to submit your sitemap yourself, or submit it to other search engines, you can submit your sitemap directly by following these steps:\n1. Go to [Google Search Console] (https://search.google.com/search-console).\n2. Select your site from the drop-down.\n3. Select Sitemaps.\n4. Enter the URL slug of the sitemap you want to submit under Add a new sitemap.\nFor example, to submit the sitemap for your entire site, enter sitemap.xml. \n5. Click Submit.\n\nYou can also submit individual page URLs directly to search engines. For example, if you make changes to one of your pages, you can re-submit only that page's URL as it will be more accurate:\n1. Go to [Google Search Console] (https://search.google.com/search-console).\n2. Select your site from the drop-down.\n3. Enter the URL that you want to index in the search bar at the top and click the Enter key.\nNote: Make sure you enter the full URL, including \"https://www\" in the beginning.\n4. Click Request Indexing.\n",

      "reference_answer": "If you have not received your payment in your bank account yet, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Check Verification Status**: Ensure that your Wix Payments account is successfully verified. Incomplete verification can delay payouts. You can learn more about the verification process [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-payments-verification-process).\n\n2. **Review Bank Details**: Verify that the bank details associated with your Wix Payments account are correct. Incorrect bank details can cause payouts to fail. You can update your bank details by following the steps outlined [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/failed-payout-in-wix-payments).\n\n3. **Check Payout Schedule**: Confirm your payout schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly) and allow 3-5 business days for the funds to appear in your bank account after the payout is sent. More information on payout schedules can be found [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/changing-your-wix-payments-payout-schedule).\n\n4. **Look for Failed Payouts**: Check your Wix Payments dashboard for any failed payouts. If a payout has failed, it will be marked as 'Failed' and placed on hold until the issue is resolved. Instructions for resolving failed payouts are available [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/failed-payout-in-wix-payments).\n\n5. **Payouts on Hold**: If there is an issue blocking your payout, it may be on hold. You can view the reason for the hold and instructions for resolving it in your Wix Payments dashboard. More information on payouts on hold can be found [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/payouts-on-hold).\n\nIf you have checked all the above and still have not received your payment, consider reaching out to Wix support for further assistance.",

      "reference_answer": "If your automation is triggering but the automated email isn't sent, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1 | Check the spam folder\nWhen you set up an automation to send an email to your contact, the email could end up in their spam folder. They (or you, if you're testing the automation) should go to their inbox and look for the email in that folder as well. Learn more about automations sent through Wix Email Marketing being marked as spam.\n\nIf checking the spam folder doesn't solve the issue, please whitelist the following emails:\n- no-reply@test.wixshoutout.com\n- If you have not set a confirmed reply-to email: @automations.ascendbywix.com\n- If you have set a confirmed reply-to email: Your email address.\n\nStep 2 | Check that the recipient's email address is active\nCheck that the recipient's email address is active and that they've subscribed to your mailing list. If they have, you'll see a \"SUBSCRIBED\" label on their contact card. If your automation sends an email to an inactive contact, the email will not go through.\n\nStep 3 | Check that the recipient's email address is valid\nCheck that the recipient\u2019s email address is valid. If it's not, the recipient won't receive an email (even if the automation was set up correctly).\n\nStep 4 |  Check that the correct trigger app is set: Ensure that your trigger app is set to Wix Forms, not Site Members or any other app.\n  \nStep 5 | Verify the correct form is selected: If you've set a specific form to trigger your automation (rather than any form), make sure you've selected the right form.\n  \nStep 6 |  Ensure there is an email/phone field in your form: If your automation's trigger is \"Form submitted,\" it relies on specific contact details to complete the action. If these contact details are missing, the action cannot be completed.\n  \nStep 7 |  Check that the email field is the correct form field type: Access the form in your Editor to manage its fields. Hover over your email field to ensure its title is \"Email Field.\"\n  \nStep 8 |  Verify that the email field is synced with an email field in your Contact List: The email field in your form needs to be synced with your Contact List. The synced field must be either \"Email\" or \"Email (Main).\" If it\u2019s anything else, it won't work as an email field. Without this sync, a contact is not created, and an automated email cannot be sent.\n  \nStep 9 |  Check if you hold multiple email addresses for one contact: Access the contact's contact card to see if you have multiple email addresses for them. If a contact has multiple email addresses, automated emails are usually sent to an additional email rather than the contact's main/primary email. Contacts with only one email address are not affected.",
