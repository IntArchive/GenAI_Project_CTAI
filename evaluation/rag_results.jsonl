Hover over your email field to make sure its title is **Email Field**.\n\nStep 5 | **Check that the email field is synced with an email field in your Contact List**:\n                The email field in your form needs to be synced to your Contact List. The field synced must be either**Email**or **Email (Main)**. If it\u2019s anything else, it won't work as an email field. After your visitor submits such a form, a contact is not created and an automated email cannot be sent. \n\nStep 6 | **Check if you hold multiple emails addresses for one contact**:\n                [Access your contact's contact card](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-contacts-managing-your-contact-list) to see if you hold multiple email addresses for them. If a contact has multiple email addresses, usually automated emails are sent to an additional email rather than the contact's main/primary email. \n                Contacts you hold only one email address for are not affected. \n                If you're logged in and testing your form using multiple email addresses, your site will recognize that these are all from your login and will merge them under one contact. For this reason, the automation will not be delivering emails as you may expect.\n\nStep 7 | **Check the frequency**: Check if the automation was set to run once per contact.\nIf you've set your automation to **Send once per contact**, it only runs the first time your visitor (or you, if you're testing your automation) performs the action.\n    * [Go to Automations](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Open%20Wix%20Automations&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/triggers/) in your site's dashboard.\n    *Hover over the relevant automation and click the More Actions icon ![](https://d2x3xhvgiqkx42.cloudfront.net/12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab/be0b50df-801c-4d6d-b81c-dc49333eccac/2022/06/13/f9f288b6-e50a-40a5-883c-760ea19977d4/a6310292-8619-4733-a7a7-88933f302063.png).\n    * Click **Edit**.\n    * Click the **Timing** drop\\-down.\n    * In the **Limit frequency to** drop\\-down, check if **Once per contact** is selected.

{"question": "Im having trouble with my site not being indexed by Google. Ive checked that my site is published and not password protected, but its still not being indexed.", "reference_answer": "Please follow these steps:\n1. Make sure that search engines can index your site\nYou can choose whether or not to allow search engines to index your site in your [SEO Settings] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/customizing-your-seo-settings-1420929). It's important to let search engines index your site if you want it to appear in search engine results. \n\n1. Go to your [SEO Dashboard] (https://manage.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO).\n2. Select Go to SEO Settings under Tools and settings.\n3. Make sure the Let search engines index your site toggle is enabled.\n\n2. Check the index status of your page\nIf you're not sure about the index status of a page, you can use [Google's URL Inspection tool] (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) or [the Wix Site Inspection tool] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-site-inspection-an-overview) to check it. These tools can tell you if your page is indexed or if there are any issues that are preventing it from being indexed.\n\n3. Check if your pages has any redirects\nWix's URL Redirect Manager lets you create 301 redirects for pages on your site. 301 redirects tell web browsers that the URL of a page on your site has changed permanently to a new URL. It also tells browsers that visitors who try to access the page's old URL should be sent to the new URL instead.\n\nIf your page has a 301 redirect and the page doesn't appear in search results, try deleting the redirect.\n\n1. [Go to your SEO Dashboard] (https://manage.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO).\n2. Select Go to URL Redirect Manager under Tools and settings.\n3. Hover over the 301 redirect that you want to delete.\n4. Click the Delete icon . \n\n4. Submit Sitemap: Make sure your sitemap is submitted to Google. Wix automatically submits your sitemap, but you can also do it [manually via Google Search Console] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/submitting-your-sitemap-and-urls-directly-to-search-engines).\n\nHowever, search engines cannot guarantee that every page of your site will be indexed.

{"question": "Im troubleshooting why my automated email isnt being sent after a form submission. Ive confirmed that Ive checked the automation statistics.", "reference_answer": "If your automation is triggering but the automated email isn't sent, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1 | Check the spam folder\nWhen you set up an automation to send an email to your contact, the email could end up in their spam folder. They (or you, if you're testing the automation) should go to their inbox and look for the email in that folder as well. Learn more about automations sent through Wix Email Marketing being marked as spam.\n\nIf checking the spam folder doesn't solve the issue, please whitelist the following emails:\n- no-reply@test.wixshoutout.com\n- If you have not set a confirmed reply-to email: @automations.ascendbywix.com\n- If you have set a confirmed reply-to email: Your email address.\n\nStep 2 | Check that the recipient's email address is active\nCheck that the recipient's email address is active and that they've subscribed to your mailing list. If they have, you'll see a \"SUBSCRIBED\" label on their contact card. If your automation sends an email to an inactive contact, the email will not go through.\n\nStep 3 | Check that the recipient's email address is valid\nCheck that the recipient\u2019s email address is valid. If it's not, the recipient won't receive an email (even if the automation was set up correctly).\n\nStep 4 |  Check that the correct trigger app is set: Ensure that your trigger app is set to Wix Forms, not Site Members or any other app.\n  \nStep 5 | Verify the correct form is selected: If you've set a specific form to trigger your automation (rather than any form), make sure you've selected the right form.\n  \nStep 6 |  Ensure there is an email/phone field in your form: If your automation's trigger is \"Form submitted,\" it relies on specific contact details to complete the action. If these contact details are missing, the action cannot be completed.\n  \nStep 7 |  Check that the email field is the correct form field type: Access the form in your Editor to manage its fields. Hover over your email field to ensure its title is \"Email Field.\"\n  \nStep 8 |  Verify that the email field is synced with an email field in your Contact List: The email field in your form needs to be synced with your Contact List. The synced field must be either \"Email\" or \"Email (Main).\" If it\u2019s anything else, it won't work as an email field. Without this sync, a contact is not created, and an automated email cannot be sent.\n  \nStep 9 |  Check if you hold multiple email addresses for one contact: Access the contact's contact card to see if you have multiple email addresses for them. If a contact has multiple email addresses, automated emails are usually sent to an additional email rather than the contact's main/primary email.

{"question": "My old website pages are still showing on Google despite updating the SEO. I have already tried removing the old URLs and submitting the updated sitemap to Google, but the issue persists.", "reference_answer": "Search engines crawl and index content from every page that you publish, with the exception of pages that you prevented search engines from indexing, pages that are password protected. Just as it takes search engines time to crawl and index a new website, it also takes time for them to recognize that a website or old URLs have changed or are no longer available. This can happen if you deleted a page, image, or file from your site, or if you edited the URL of one of your pages. The process of removing pages and files from search results and how long it takes depends entirely on the individual search engines. This also applies to images appearing in Google Images search results.\n\nThere are a few steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. **Use Google's URL Removal Tool**: You can request Google to remove outdated URLs using the [URL removal tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9689846?hl=en). Ensure your site is verified with Google Search Console to use this tool.\n\n2. **Check for Redirects**: Ensure that any old URLs are properly redirected to the new URLs using 301 redirects. This can help maintain SEO rankings and guide users to the correct pages. You can set up redirects using the [Wix URL Redirect Manager](https://support.wix.com/en/article/setting-up-a-301-redirect-for-a-page-on-your-site).\n\n3. **Request Indexing**: After making changes, request Google to recrawl your site by using the [URL Inspection Tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) in Google Search Console.\n\n4. **Check for 'noindex' Tags**: Ensure that your new pages do not have 'noindex' tags, which would prevent them from appearing in search results.", "predicted_answer": "I am not sure based on the given documents.", "metrics": {"exact_match": 0.0, "containment": 0.0, "similarity": 0.004659289458357601}, "retrieved_doc_ids": ["7a2a95eef86788654dd78c208baa0f8adc5ba65cdf05d27b90ebf747d87ca171", "fda5d55a46aafa7371e4858ddeab1f746f686c36f8ad62e6cfc92804c0a69dc2", "e275461d2a6bda626599668963494a63ab36f71f86f20b01b0bcb76fb60ec5ac", "568140964e5e7c1628d295e9991367ed4d3c2090a79105d435231030b620a506", "568140964e5e7c1628d295e9991367ed4d3c2090a79105d435231030b620a506"], "ground_truth_ids": ["7a2a95eef86788654dd78c208baa0f8adc5ba65cdf05d27b90ebf747d87ca171", "24953d9f24a1cd711d55a2a3729dd74257e6de98ea882b8a9ae49e2d2720d1fa", "568140964e5e7c1628d295e9991367ed4d3c2090a79105d435231030b620a506"], "collection_name": "wixqa_recursive_chunks", "model_name": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B", "top_k": 5}

{"question": "My site is unable to provide a secure connection.", "reference_answer": "The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a security measure used by websites and browsers for communicating over the internet. A site which has an SSL certificate is secure, meaning that any data exchanged between you and the site is encrypted. A website that implements SSL has \u201cHTTPS\u201d in its URL instead of \u201cHTTP\u201d.\nIf you're having issues viewing your site over a secure HTTPS connection, follow the steps below to troubleshoot your SSL certificate.\nStep 1 | Make sure your DNS records are correct\nFor your SSL certificate to be enabled, your domain needs to be connected to your site. \nReview your domain's connection method below to check you have the correct DNS records and ensure that your domain is properly connected. \nIf your domain is connected via name servers:\nMake sure your domain host has the following name servers set for your domain:\n\nTo connect your domain to Wix, setup your name servers as follows:\n\nns2.wixdns.net  (216.239.36.100)\nns3.wixdns.net  (216.239.38.100)\n* Please only add the IP addresses if required by your domain host.\n\nNote: Contact your domain host if you need help configuring your name servers.\n\nMake sure you have the default A and CNAME records in your Wix account:\n[Go to Domains] (https://premium.wix.com/wix/api/mpContainerStaticController#/domains) in your Wix account.\nClick the More Actions icon  next to the relevant domain.\nSelect Manage DNS Records.\nCheck the records under the A (Host) and CNAME (Aliases) sections.\n\nIf your domain is connected via pointing:\nMake sure your domain host has the following DNS records for your domain:\nA record: \nHost name: @ (or empty)\nValue: 185.230.63.107\nCNAME:\nHost name: www (or www.yourdomain.com)\nValue: pointing.wixdns.net\nNote: Contact your domain host if you need help configuring your DNS records.\n\nIf you purchased your domain from Wix:\nMake sure you have the default A and CNAME records in your Wix account:\n[Go to Domains] (https://premium.wix.com/wix/api/mpContainerStaticController#/domains) in your Wix account.\nClick the More Actions icon  next to the relevant domain.\nSelect Manage DNS Records.\nCheck the records under the A (Host) and CNAME (Aliases) sections.\n\nStep 2 | Wait until your domain has propagated\nIf you recently updated your DNS records, wait up to 48 hours to allow your domain to complete propagation. Domain propagation is the process of updating the global chain of DNS servers around the world with the changes you made, ensuring that your site is up to date whenever anyone accesses it. \n\nStep 3 | Ensure that DNSSEC is not signed\nIf you purchased your domain outside of Wix, check with your domain host to make sure that DNSSEC is not signed for your domain as it can interrupt the propagation process.\nIf you purchased your domain from Wix, disregard this step as all Wix domains have DNSSEC automatically not signed.\n\nStep 4 | Ensure only HTTPS code is entered in the HTML element\nIf you have an [HTML element] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-embedding-a-site-or-a-widget) on your site that contains HTTP in the code (instead of HTTPS), you may see a message in your browser indicating your site is not fully secure.\nMake sure the code you enter contains HTTPS (and not HTTP). If you've added code with http:// in it, remove it or replace it with https:// code. \nGoogle notification showing an unsecure web address,\nTo replace the code in an HTML element:\nIn your Editor, navigate to the page you've added the HTML element. \nClick the HTML element.\nClick Edit Code.\nUnder Add your code here (HTTPS only): make sure the code does not contain http:// in it.  \nClick Publish at the top right of your Editor.\nNote: If you have multiple HTML elements, repeat the steps to make sure each is using HTTPS code only. \n\nImportant:\nOlder operating systems can sometimes [fail to recognise a modern SSL Certificate] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/ssl-certificate-not-showing-on-devices-running-older-windows-or-mac-operating-systems).\nThis does not mean there is an issue with your site's SSL Certificate.

{"question": "My website does not appear in search engine results. I need help with indexing and optimizing my site's SEO to ensure it gets listed.", "reference_answer": "When you publish your site, most of your pages are available for search engines like Google to crawl and index so that they can appear in search results. It can take some time for your page to appear. \nHowever, search engines cannot guarantee that every page of your site will be indexed. It's important to note that this is perfectly normal in many cases. \n\nTo check if your site was indexed by search engines, search \"site:\" followed by your site's domain with no spaces. For example: site:wix.com\n  If any of your domain's pages are listed in the search results, those pages have been indexed. If there are no results for your domain, your website has not been indexed yet. \n\nStep 1 Check that you have allowed search engines to crawl and index your site.\n\nTo enable search engines to index your site:\n1. [Go to your SEO dashboard.] (https://manage.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO)\n2. Select Go to SEO Settings under Tools and settings.\n3. Make sure the Let search engines index your site toggle is enabled.\n\nStep 2 Check if your pages has any redirects\nWix's URL Redirect Manager lets you create 301 redirects for pages on your site. 301 redirects tell web browsers that the URL of a page on your site has changed permanently to a new URL. It also tells browsers that visitors who try to access the page's old URL should be sent to the new URL instead.\n\nIf your page has a 301 redirect and the page doesn't appear in search results, try deleting the redirect.\n\n1. [Go to your SEO Dashboard.] (https://manage.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO)\n2. Select Go to URL Redirect Manager under Tools and settings.\n3. Hover over the 301 redirect that you want to delete.\n4. Click the Delete icon \n\nStep 3 We recommend using the Wix [SEO Setup Checklist] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/improving-your-online-presence-with-the-wix-seo-setup-checklist) to optimize your site's SEO and submit your site to Google for indexing. The SEO Setup Checklist helps you pick the best keywords, title tags, and meta descriptions to rank higher. It also helps you connect your site to Google Search Console.\nAfter you've completed the SEO Setup Checklist, your site is submitted directly to Google for indexing.\n\nStep 4 Sitemaps give information to search engines like which pages are on your site and when they were last updated. Every Wix site has a sitemap that updates automatically with your site\u2019s most current information. Learn more about your site's sitemap file\nWhen you complete the steps in your Wix SEO Setup Checklist, Wix automatically submits your sitemap index to Google for you. When you make changes to your site, your sitemap will be automatically updated with the changes. There's no need to submit your sitemap to Google again. \nIf you want to submit your sitemap yourself, or submit it to other search engines, you can submit your sitemap directly. \n\n1. Go to [Google Search Console.] (https://search.google.com/search-console)\n2. Select your site from the drop-down.\n3. Select Sitemaps.\n4. Enter the URL slug of the sitemap you want to submit under Add a new sitemap.\nFor example, to submit the sitemap for your entire site, enter sitemap.xml. \n5. Click Submit.\n\nStep 5 If your site is indexed, but not showing as high as you like in search results, [optimizing your site's content for SEO] (https://support.wix.com/en/article/optimizing-your-sites-content-for-seo) can help your site rank higher. Similar to the SEO Setup Checklist, optimizing your site's content  helps search engines find and understand your site.\nA more technical but powerful way to improve your site's ranking is to use structured data markup. This is a standardized format for giving search engines detailed information about your page. \nAdding markup to your site's pages can help improve your website's search results and ranking. Search engines like Google can also use markup to [create rich results] (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/search-gallery) like article previews, product previews, and FAQs for your page's search results.
